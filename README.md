## 📌 About the Project

**Sentiment Analysis Classifier** is a Machine Learning project that analyzes movie reviews and classifies them as either **Positive** 😊 or **Negative** 😞.

The project demonstrates a complete **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning pipeline**, starting from raw text data and ending with a trained model capable of making predictions on new, unseen reviews.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**, containing **50,000 labeled movie reviews**.

| Category         | Details             |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Total Reviews    | 50,000              |
| Positive Reviews | 25,000              |
| Negative Reviews | 25,000              |
| Classes          | Positive / Negative |
| Domain           | Movie Reviews       |

The dataset provides balanced positive and negative examples, making it suitable for binary sentiment classification.

## 🧠 NLP Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration

The dataset is first explored to understand:

* Number of reviews
* Positive/negative class distribution
* Sample reviews
* Missing values
* Dataset structure

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing

Raw reviews are cleaned before being passed to the Machine Learning model.

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

* Lowercasing
* Punctuation removal
* Stopword removal
* Text normalization

Example:

```text
"This Movie Was AMAZING!"
              ↓
"this movie was amazing"
```

### 3️⃣ TF-IDF Vectorization

Since Machine Learning models cannot directly understand raw text, the cleaned reviews are converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**.

TF-IDF assigns importance to words based on how frequently they appear in a document compared with the entire collection of documents.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project explores two popular classification algorithms:

### 🔹 Naive Bayes

A probabilistic algorithm that is commonly used for text classification tasks.

### 🔹 Logistic Regression

A powerful and widely used algorithm for binary classification and a strong baseline for NLP problems.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using multiple metrics:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **Confusion Matrix**

### Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| ------------------- | -------: | --------: | -----: |
| Naive Bayes         |      TBD |       TBD |    TBD |
| Logistic Regression |      TBD |       TBD |    TBD |

> 📝 **Note:** Update the values above with the actual results after running the training pipeline.

## 🧪 Custom Prediction

The trained model can also be used to classify your own movie reviews.

### Example

```python
from src.predict import predict_sentiment

predict_sentiment("This movie was absolutely fantastic!")
```

### Output

```text
Positive
```

Another example:

```python
predict_sentiment("The movie was boring and disappointing.")
```

### Output

```text
Negative
```
